        <h3>About Us</h3>

        <h4>Who We Are</h4>
        <p>We are an all-female law and public safety team who believe that women are overlooked in the public safety
            field. We started our company to prove that women can do anything that a man can do and look good while
            doing it.</p>
        <p>Our company is run by four highly-trained professional women who had a dream to show what we are capable of.
            Our company was established in 2020 and is ran by Yahaira Lopez, Mackenzie Evinger, Kimberly Cordova, and
            Michelle Fuentes.</p>
        <h4>Our Process</h4>
        <p>
            As women, we have a lot of places to hide things such as weapons. We are discrete with our
            tactics and how we do things. We are all trained security guards so we have the capability of
            protecting our clientele. People would never expect a group of all females to be the ones
            defending the celebrities, we use that as an advantage in order to pop out unexpectedly.
